# GetMyRun
GetMyRun is a small Python program written to scrape Google Sheets data which, in this case, contains training information, and return it to the user.

Ideally, this tool will remove the step of opening a browse or app. An example of the current result is below.

Next steps include figuring out the best solution for presenting the data. In a notification or message, maybe?
